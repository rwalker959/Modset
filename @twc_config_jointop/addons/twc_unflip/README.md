# TWC_Unflip
This is a modified version of VET_Unflipping: https://github.com/veteran29/vet_unflipping

I have stripped all setting features, adjusted values, and added in dynamicing timing on a per mass basis (also divded by the amount of participants). Additionally, ACE interaction is done via Config, not script.
